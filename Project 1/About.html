	<h2> Hello World!</h2>
	<p>My name is Tiffini Tobiasson.</p>
	<p>I am currently a student enrolled at the Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago, Illinois. I am studying Computer Science and minoring in Internet Application Development. 
	My hopes after graduating in Spring of 2019 are to attend the Institute of Design to persue a Masters in Design. </p>
	<p>I was born and raised in Tucson, Arizona where I went to school in the Vail School District. In high school I was heavily involved in my FIRST Robotics team; Team 1828 The BoxerBots.</p>
	<p>Outside of school and work, I like to spend my free time listening to EDM Music and attending music festivals. I enjoy hula hooping as a form of exercise, and yes, it can be a lot more complicated than simply moving the hoop around your hips. I also have many crafting hobbies including: cross stitching, crocheting, knitting, painting and wire wraping. </p>
